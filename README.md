### Task 1
* What is the difference between a container and an image?
The main difference between the image and the container is the writable top layer.
To create a container, the Docker engine takes an image, adds a writable top layer and initializes various parameters (network ports, container name, identifier and resource limits).
### Task 2 - Infra
* Ready infrastructure for reddit-docker-app has the following form
1. Infra
    1. ansible
        1. environments
            1. inventory.gcp.yml 
        2. playbooks
            1. base.yml
            2. deploy.yml
            3. docker.yml
            4. site.yml
        3. ansible.cfg
        4. requirements.txt
    2. packer
        1. docker.json
        2. variables.json.example
    3. terraform
        1. main.tf
        2. outputs.tf
        3. terraform.tfvars.example
        4. variables.tf
1) We bake python, pip, docker.io, pip-docker module into the image (packer + ansible provisioning)
2) With Terraform, we deploy the required number of instances from the finished image
3) We launch a playbook that checks whether everything is installed, downloads the docker image and launches it
